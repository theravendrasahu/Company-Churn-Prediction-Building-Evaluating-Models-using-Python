# Telco Customer Churn Analysis ðŸ“Š

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to identify key factors influencing customer retention. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore trends and patterns that contribute to churn.

## Key Insights
Churn Rate: 26.54% of customers have churned.
Customer Tenure: Short-term customers (1-2 months) are more likely to leave, whereas long-term users tend to stay.
Senior Citizens: Higher churn rate among senior citizens compared to younger customers.
Contract Type: Monthly contract users are more likely to churn than those with yearly contracts.
Service Subscription: Customers who opt out of additional services (e.g., online security, tech support) have higher churn rates.
## Recommendations
Improve onboarding for new customers to enhance retention in the first few months.
Promote long-term contracts with discounts and added benefits.
Create personalized offers for senior citizens to improve engagement.
Encourage service bundling (internet + security + support) to enhance customer stickiness.
Use predictive analytics to proactively target at-risk customers with retention strategies.
