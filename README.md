## **📌 Overview**  
Customer churn is a major challenge for telecom companies, impacting revenue and long-term business growth. This project explores a **Telco Customer Churn dataset** to identify key factors influencing customer retention and churn.  

By leveraging **data analysis and visualization**, we uncover patterns that help businesses **predict and reduce churn**, ultimately improving customer loyalty.  

---

## **📂 Dataset**  
The dataset consists of customer information, service usage details, and churn labels. Key attributes include:  
- **Demographics:** Gender, Senior Citizen status, Dependents  
- **Account Information:** Tenure, Contract Type, Billing Method  
- **Services Subscribed:** Internet Service, Online Security, Tech Support, Streaming Services  
- **Churn Status:** Whether the customer stayed or left  

---

## **🔍 Methodology**  
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values and data inconsistencies.  
   - Converted categorical variables for better analysis.  
   - Standardized numerical values for consistency.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Used **visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps)** to detect patterns.  
   - Examined correlations between customer attributes and churn.  

3. **Key Insights Extraction:**  
   - Analyzed churn based on customer tenure, contract type, service subscriptions, and demographics.

## **📊 Key Findings**  
✔ **Churn Rate:** 26.54% of customers have churned.  
✔ **New Customers Leave Quickly:** Customers using the service for **1-2 months** are more likely to churn, while long-term users tend to stay.  
✔ **Senior Citizens Have a Higher Churn Rate** compared to younger customers.  
✔ **Contract Type Matters:** **Monthly contract users churn significantly more** than those with **1-year or 2-year contracts**.  
✔ **Service Subscription Affects Retention:** Customers **who don’t subscribe to additional services** (e.g., security, tech support) have a higher likelihood of churning.

## **📢 Recommendations**  
✅ **Enhance the onboarding experience** to engage customers early and prevent quick churn.  
✅ **Encourage long-term contracts** with discounts and additional benefits.  
✅ **Develop personalized plans for senior citizens** to improve retention.  
✅ **Promote service bundling** (Internet + Security + Tech Support) to increase customer loyalty.  
✅ **Leverage predictive analytics** to proactively identify at-risk customers and offer retention strategies.
